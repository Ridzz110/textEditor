# textEditor
a simple text editor with font styling feature.
i tried to create a functioning text editor/notepad on QT creator.
it is basically a qt widget based app.
that aims to achieve following objectives:
1. simple file handling.
2. copy,paste and cut text(short cut keys ctrl + C,V and X)
3. it also use fontdialog for font styling and sizing(bold, italic and underline works there)
4. failed to achieve some of the features in the format tab.
